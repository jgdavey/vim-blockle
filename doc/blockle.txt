INTRODUCTION                                          *blockle*

This plugin allows rapid toggling between the two different styles of ruby
blocks, namely do/end and brackets {}. To use, simply move the cursor to the
beginning or end of a block, and type <Leader>b. As a mnemonic, remember 'b'
for 'block'.

Note: You must have your cursor on the do, end, {, or } for the plugin to work
correctly.

When moving from a do/end to a bracket-style block, the plugin with attempt to
move to a one-liner if appropriate:

For example, if have the following ruby code (* indicates cursor position):
>
  ['one', 'two'].each d*o |number|
    puts number + "!"
  end
>
After invoking <Leader>b, the resulting code would be:
>
  ['one', 'two'].each *{ |number| puts number + "!" }
>

MAPPINGS                                               *blockle-mappings*

<Leader>b   or   <Plug>BlockToggle
  Toggle ruby block style

To add your own mapping, add something like the following to your vim configuration:
>
  map <D-j> <Plug>BlockToggle
<
which would map Super-J (Cmd-J on Mac OS) to the toggling function.
